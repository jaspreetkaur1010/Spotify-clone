# Spotify-clone
This project is a frontend clone of the Spotify landing page, created as a learning exercise to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The goal was to replicate the layout, design, and interactivity of the original Spotify landing page, including responsive design for seamless viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
